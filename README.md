# Shape Calculator
### College project brief

A client has approached you about developing a piece of software that can calculate particular attributes of shapes based on a user’s input. 
The program must allow the user to select what shape and attribute they want to calculate. The program will then ask for the necessary inputs from the user to calculate the attribute.

For example, calculating the Area (attribute) of a Square (shape) based on the Height and Width (user’s input).
The following shapes and attributes are required to be calculated:
1.	Circle - Area
2.	Circle - Circumference (from the radius)
3.	Rectangle – Area
4.	Triangle – Area
5.	Cuboid - Volume 

The program must contain features that validate all user input to ensure that extreme values are not processed and invalid inputs are not processed. The program must not shut down unless the user wants to quit; any closing of the program without a user initiating a close will be considered a software crash. There must also be a help menu that explains how to use the program.

The program must be designed and developed to work as a procedural programme (including functions and parameter passing) using the C++ programming language.
